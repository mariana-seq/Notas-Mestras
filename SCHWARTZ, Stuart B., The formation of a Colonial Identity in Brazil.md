"The question of national consciousness or sel-awareness in the American colonies has too often been treated in isolation from the social and political context within the colony" 15
=="The matter of colonial distinctiveness is essentially one of collective mantality, but the evidence used to perceive the commonly shared ideals and perceptions of the *vox populi* is, in Brazil at least, generally limited to te production of a tiny group of literati, all of whom belonged to the colonial aristocracy, te bureaucracy, or the clergy."== 15-16
"Many of the marquis' reforms were ill-conceived and others bore little fruit he fell from power in 1777, but int the following two decades changing market conditions created a powerful stimulus for a dramatic rise in Brazilian exports." 17
=="In social or religious terms Brazil was created to reproduce Portugal, not to transform or transcend it." ==19
=="The first is the growth of a colonial identity that is, the definition of the colonists as somehow different from their metropolitan compatriots - a transition from immigrant to native." ==20"
"The presence of large numbers of Indians and later of Africans provided the settlers not only with the labor necessary to live in the colony but also with a sense of self-identification that reinforced the ties to Europe." 26
"I would suggest that the localism, independence, isolation, and "Indianness" of the periperal colonies were the earliest manifestations of a distintict colonial mentality." 32
"The result of Portugal's educational policy was to reinforce the intellectual dependence of the colony on the mother country and to socialize the colonials in political as well as intelectuall terms." 36-37
=="The Pombaline reforms of the mid-eighteenth century disrupted education in Brazil but also eventually set it upon a new course. The expulsion of the Jesuits in 1757 left their seventeen colleges and seminaries in Brazil empty, and only slowly did other instititutions of study develop to fil the gap."== 37-38
"The educational backwardness of the Brazilian colony symbolized a wider and more profound intellectual dependency manifested in many ways. Unlike Spanish America, no priting press operated in Brazil during the first three centuries of the colonial era (...). Any writing about Brazil ot by native-born Brazilians thus had to be published in Portugal under the watchful eye of the crown and the Inquisition." 38
"I would argue that until 1700 and probably well beyond that date that there was essentially no separate Brazilian literature and that is, too, was a result of the centralization of political an economic life in the empire. B==razilian intelectualls moved within the orbit of the mother country, usually knew it personally, and viewed themselves as partir of a broader, more inclusive tradition."== 38
"In quantitative terms the literary production of Brazil prior to 1750 is small. All the genre of the period - histories, honorific and satiric poetry, promotional literature, moral and religious tracts, sermons, and descriptions of plous and public events - were created, but this production tended to be fragmentary and dispersed with no universities to serve as focal points fot the intellectual intechange and activity."  39
=="The formations of colonial identity in Brazil was infused with ambiguities. Nativists sentiments and a growing sense of distinctiveness developed alongside the continuing tradition of loyalty as subjects of the Portuguese crown, who thereby felt themselves deserving of favour and reward."== 39
"Brazillian self-esteem and hostility to European-born Portuguese certainly existed by the late eighteenth century." 44
