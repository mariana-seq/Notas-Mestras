"The Thirty Years’ War proved catastrophic for the Habsburg dynasty, particularly for the Spanish branch of the family. Having hemorrhaged its treasury, exhausted its credit, alienated elites in its component kingdoms, and lost Portugal, Spain sought relief at the diplomatic bargaining table." 77
"In Europe, Portugal fortifi ed its international position, and
the Braganza dynasty’s tenuous political legitimacy, through a new alliance with England formed in the early 1650s, sealed by marriage between Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. Portugal was compelled to make signifi cant concessions to its new ally, ceding Tangier and transferring Bombay." 80
=="Brazil, the most lucrative, productive, and populous
extraterritorial possession, became the sun around which the other territories, including Portugal itself, orbited."== 82
